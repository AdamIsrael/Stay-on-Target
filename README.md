Stay-on-Target
==============

An OS X application to track various writing projects by deadline and word count. This is an attempt to take away the complexity of Spreadsheets used to track progress across multiple projects. A way to juggle multiple workloads for maximum efficiency.

The app should be simple to use as a progress tracker, while being customizable enough for the advanced/procrastinating writer.


# Planned Features
* Run from Menu bar
* Per-project tracking of:
  * Deadline
  * Word Count
  * Category (i.e., personal, work)
  
* Define minimum words/day before a project becomes important
* Use Notification Center to notify (daily?) of current targets
* Interface w/Scrivener
  * Link project status
  * Automatically update word count?
* Add writing session(s) to calendar
* Categories
  * Track the kind of writing that needs to be done (fiction, blogging, SEO, etc)
  * Define the number of words/day you're comfortable writing in each category
  * Priority, so you work on the most important projects first.
* Milestones?
* Under/Over-commited calculation. Know if you've got too much work on your plate, or if there's room for more.
* Cheat days
  * Sometimes you need to take a mental health day. See how your deadlines will be affected by blowing the day playing games.
* Choose the days that you want to work (like Scrivener). The deadlines would be calculated based on the days you're available to work.
* Kindness setting; allow for randomly scheduled (or surprise) days off.

# Use Cases/Scenarios

* If I know I can write 800 words of a blog (priority #3), 1,000 words of fiction (priority #2), and 2,000 words of SEO (priority #1) a day, the app should be able to figure out what SEO projects words first, then fiction, then blog.
